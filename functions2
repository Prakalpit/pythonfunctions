The argument and parameters.
in function

def hellopy(variable):
    print('the name '+ variable + ' did not come from the name of the snake.')
hellopy('Python')

 variable is the parameter that contains the argument Python.

local variables,
the parameters in a function such as the one above(variable), are called local variable. they will fade once the function ends.
you can't use the local variable outside the function.

global variables,
the variable outside the function are global variables. like:

spam=21
def hellopy(variable):
    print('the name '+ variable + ' did not come from the name of the snake.')
    print(spam)
hellopy('Python')

here 'spam' is a global variable and can be used both inside and outside the function.
